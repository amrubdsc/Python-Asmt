Repository of my simple shopping carts versions (including a README)
In this Repository, I have 3 versions of a simple shopping cart that is user-friendly. I have taken into consideration relevant implications affecting aesthetics, ensuring users' data is private, and that usability is easy to follow. The attached programs vary in features. Version 1 contains the least amount of features, but gets the job done. Version 2 takes advantage of increasing the amount of items that are available for the user to purchase, while Verison 3 takes a step further in allowing the user to track their spending history after every transaction made, with corresponding dates and the price of transaction.
I hope you enjoy these programs.
